## [Unreleased]
### New features
- Added DirectX 9 support. However, TR2Main can be compiled for DirectX 5 too.
- Into TR2Main.dll added information about the current version. Now it will be easier to find out which DLL is which version.
- The number of secrets in the script is taken into account when calculating the total number of secrets in the final statistics. Now it is calculated correctly, regardless of the total number of levels, bonus levels, and even mod levels.
- Additional checks have been implemented to prevent Lara from getting weapons that are not supported by current level. Thus, a number of problems associated with the "Nightmare in Vegas" level are fixed.
- Now *"New Game+"* is activated after the completion of the latest level in the script, and not any in which the final statistics appear. This allows you to activate this mode after the "Nightmare in Vegas" level, and not before.
- Now you can start the game in Gold mode, specifying the option *"-gold"* on the command line or shortcut properties (in the same way as the *"-setup"* option).
- For the Gold mode, Spider and Big Spider AI replaced by Wolf and Bear AI. Also Monk Spirits have no shadow.
- For the Gold mode, the credits slideshow starts from *CREDIT00.PCX*. For the original game mode, it starts from *CREDIT01.PCX*.
- For the Gold mode, the selection of any levels (including bonus levels) is activated after collecting all the secrets (available before the final statistics). The ability to select levels remains even after relaunching the game.
- For the Gold mode, pictures with "g" filename suffix (TITLEg.PCX, LEGALg.PCX, etc.) have higher priority than pictures without "g" filename suffix (TITLE.PCX, LEGAL.PCX, etc.)
- For the Gold mode, instead of the files *"TOMBPC.DAT"* and *"MAIN.SFX"*, the files *"TOMBPCg.DAT"* and *"MAINg.SFX"* are used. However, for both Gold and the original game, *"MAIN.SFX"* is still used for the *"TITLE.TR2"* and *"ASSAULT.TR2"* levels.
- Added separate subfolders for saved games of Gold and the original game.
- Added PlayStation reflection visual effect.

- Rolling wheel blades, wall mounted blades, swords of statues and flamethrower masks are made reflective. This is how they look in the PlayStation version.
- The armed snowmobile windshield is made reflective. This is not presented in the PlayStation version, but probably it was supposed to be. Anyway it looks cool!
- The original game fast snowmobile windshield is made semitransparent (alpha blending required). This is how it looks in the PlayStation version.
- The Golden Mask fast snowmobile windshield is made reflective. In the Golden Mask it has the same windshield model as the armed snowmobile.
- Boathouse Key and Library Key from Venice levels are made reflective. This is how they look in the PlayStation version.
- The water surfaces and the glass on the sink in Lara's bathroom are made semitransparent (alpha blending required). This is how they look in the PlayStation version.
- Chain-link fence texture from Venice levels and stained glass texture from "Wreck of the Maria Doria" level are made semitransparent (alpha blending required). This is how they look in the PlayStation version.
- The glass on the sink in the "Nightmare in Vegas" level is made semitransparent (alpha blending required).

### The original game bugfixes
- Fixed a bug that prevented the display of the save counter until the game relaunch, if the game was saved in an empty slot.
- Fixed a bug that allowed the player to interfere with the control of the demo level.
- Demo levels are excluded from the *"New Game"* menu, if the *"Select Level"* option is active.
- Fixed the statistics reset in case of *"New Game+"*, if the *"Select Level"* option is active.
- Fixed a bug that does not happen in the official levels (this situation is not in the script). Suppose a shotgun and shotgun ammo are set as a bonus for collecting all the secrets in the level. If Lara does not have a shotgun at the moment of picking the last secret, she receives the relying bonus, but the ammo items are not displayed on the screen. This is fixed now.
- Fixed a bug that does not happen in the official levels (this situation is not in the script). Suppose a magnum and magnum ammo are set as a bonus for collecting all the secrets in the level. If Lara does not have a magnum at the moment of picking the last secret, she receives the magnum only, but not the magnum ammo. This is fixed now.
- Fixed a bug that hid the ammo indicator in demo levels if *"New Game+"* is activated.
- Fixed a bug that produced black triangles originating from the top left of the screen on some laptop graphic adapters.
- Fixed a bug that produced traces of previous textures in untextured areas.

- Fixed incorrect sorting of 3D polygons if Z-Buffer is turned off or the software renderer is used.

- Fixed a bug that caused the harpoon gun to reload every single shot in *"New Game+"* after a weapon cheat was used.
